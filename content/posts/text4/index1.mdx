In CSS you can use variables to store information and reference it later in your app using the variable name. This make writing CSS a lot easier, because it cuts down on having to type the same things over and over when you need to make changes in multiple places.

## Declaring CSS variables

You can declare a css variable inside of any CSS declaration block `{}` type `--variable-name` as the property, then set the value. We'll use red.

```css
body {
    --main-color: red;
}
```

## Using CSS variables

To use a CSS variable you need the `var()` function. Type `var(variable-name)` inside of the declaration block you want to use the variable on. 

```css
button {
    color: var(--main-color)
}
```

This is useful because now anywhere you need to change the `main-color` you change it once and it changes everywhere `main-color` is referenced. Without CSS variables you would have to go and change each red color manually. ðŸ˜«

## CSS Variable Scope

The CSS selector that you add the variable on, is available to all the children of that element. For example, a variable inside a `<div>` will be useuable by all the elements inside that `<div>`. 

CSS variables are based on CSS specificity and the most specific selector used will be the one that shows in the browser.

For example in this code:

```css
body {
    --main-color: red;
}

header {
    --main-color: blue;
}
```

Any element that uses `main-color` outside of `header` will be red. Any element that uses `main-color` inside of `header` will be blue.
