*"Fear is not real. The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future. It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist. That is near insanity. Do not misunderstand me, danger is very real, but fear is a choice." - Will Smith (After Earth)*

While after Earth was not that quote alone has stuck with me for years. I don't think I will ever forget it. Everytime I get "scared" this qoute pops in my head every time getting stronger and louder. Think about every time I say "I want to start a business, write a book, speak at conference, etc" I "feel" fear but why? Why am I afraid of something that hasn't ever happen yet?

Another great example of why fear is useless, Will Smith said before his first time sky diving he had all this trouble sleeping, feeling sick to his stomach and thinking about jumping out of the plane. He was thinking about all the bad things that could happen. When he was on the plane he was filled with terror. Then once he was pushed out of the plane in one second he was filled woth bliss because he was flying.

The lesson he learned was it didn't even make sense to be sacred before eating, sleeping , and driving has nothing to do with jumping out of a plane. There is no reason to be scared it just ruins your day. The best things in life are on the other side of terror.

I know that was deep but I can say it's true sometimes we're scared to write a blog post, speak at a conference, record a video course, go on a podcast, whatever it may be we have fear. If you can remember none of those thing that we thought were going to happen actually happened! Once you hit published on the blog post it felt great, once you spoke at the conference it felt great. 

I want to lean into fear more and more as I live more heck I was "scared" because it wasnt't tech related. There are many things I have backed down from doing because of fear(selling an ebook, creating video courese, starting a business, etc). I know that the fear I'm feeling isn't real it's just a choice I'm making either consciously or subconsciously. I also know in my heart if I go for the things that scared I will feel bliss from being able to people, create comfort for my family, and no longer feel that fear in the back of my head no more what ifs? That in itself is pure bliss, knowing you gave you all.

What's something that fear has held you back from?
